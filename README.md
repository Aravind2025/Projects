Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) in radar imagery is a critical technology used in defense and surveillance to identify and classify objects, such as vehicles and aircraft, from radar data. 

Traditional methods rely heavily on handcrafted features and rule-based algorithms, which are often limited in accuracy and adaptability.

Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have revolutionized ATR by automating feature extraction and learning from vast amounts of radar data.

CNNs can efficiently handle the complexity and variability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, making them ideal for identifying targets under diverse environmental conditions.
 
This study explores how machine learning methods, specifically CNN architectures like AlexNet and VGG, can enhance ATR's accuracy and efficiency in radar imagery.
